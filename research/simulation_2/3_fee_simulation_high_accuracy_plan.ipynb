        "## Uniswap v3 Historical Fee Simulation — High-Accuracy Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective: Build a tick-precise, contract-faithful simulator to compute fees for arbitrary ranges and times. This mirrors Uniswap v3 core: per-tick swap traversal, exact fee growth accounting, protocol fee handling, and position fee queries using fee growth inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 0) Fidelity goals\n",
        "- Replicate core mechanics:\n",
        "  - Tick-by-tick swap progression (`swapStep`), exact rounding rules.\n",
        "  - Active liquidity updates at tick crossings via `liquidityNet`.\n",
        "  - Global fee growth in Q128 per liquidity (token0/1), and `feeGrowthOutside` updates at tick crossings.\n",
        "  - Protocol fee extraction per token (from `slot0.feeProtocol`).\n",
        "- Deterministic integer math only (Q64.96 for prices, Q128 for fee growth), no floating-point.\n",
        "- Support queries for any `(tickLower, tickUpper)` over a window via `feeGrowthInside` deltas (fast for RL search).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1) Data requirements and initialization\n",
        "- **Mandatory**\n",
        "  - Swaps: `amount0, amount1, sqrtPriceX96, tick, liquidity, evt_block_time` in chronological order.\n",
        "  - Mints/Burns: full history up to and through the simulation window, or a tick snapshot at `t0`.\n",
        "  - Pool config: `fee`, `tickSpacing`, `token0/1`, token decimals.\n",
        "  - Slot0 snapshots: for initial state (`sqrtPriceX96`, `tick`, `feeProtocol`).\n",
        "- **Tick state at t0 (critical)**\n",
        "  - Build `liquidityNet` map at tick boundaries as of `t0`:\n",
        "    - Option A (preferred): load a tick snapshot (liquidityGross/liquidityNet per initialized tick).\n",
        "    - Option B: reconstruct by replaying all `mints`/`burns` from pool inception to `t0`.\n",
        "  - Initialize active liquidity `L_active` from `slot0` at `t0`:\n",
        "    - Sum `liquidityNet` for ticks ≤ current `tick`, respecting v3 core convention.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2) Core state and units\n",
        "- Global state (at any time):\n",
        "  - `sqrtPriceX96` (Q64.96), `tick` (int), `L_active` (uint128), `fee` (uint24, hundredths of a bip).\n",
        "  - `feeProtocol` (two 4-bit values packed in `slot0.feeProtocol` → token0, token1 share).\n",
        "  - `feeGrowthGlobal0X128`, `feeGrowthGlobal1X128` (uint256, Q128 per liquidity unit).\n",
        "- Per tick boundary `t`:\n",
        "  - `liquidityNet[t]` (int128): net liquidity change when crossing `t` upward.\n",
        "  - `feeGrowthOutside0X128[t]`, `feeGrowthOutside1X128[t]`.\n",
        "- Position query uses only growth deltas; no need to track per-position state during simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3) Exact math (from whitepaper / core)\n",
        "- Price and ticks:\n",
        "  - `P = sqrtPriceX96 / 2^96`; token1/token0 price = `P^2 * 10^(dec0 - dec1)` (for display only).\n",
        "  - `tick <-> sqrtPrice`: `sqrtPriceAtTick(t)`, `tickAtSqrtPrice(P)` per v3 formulas.\n",
        "- Liquidity math (amounts vs L):\n",
        "  - Use standard v3 `getAmount0Delta`, `getAmount1Delta` with exact rounding rules.\n",
        "- Fee accounting per step:\n",
        "  - Given step input amount and fee, `feeAmount = floor(amountIn * fee / 1e6)`.\n",
        "  - Protocol fee share per token: extracted via `feeProtocol`; subtract from `feeAmount` before adding to growth.\n",
        "  - `feeGrowthGlobal{0,1}X128 += (feeAmount_remaining << 128) / L_active`.\n",
        "- Tick crossing:\n",
        "  - When crossing tick `t` upward:\n",
        "    - `feeGrowthOutside{0,1}[t]` updated to current `feeGrowthGlobal{0,1}X128` if first time on that side.\n",
        "    - `L_active += liquidityNet[t]`.\n",
        "  - Crossing downward applies inverse net and outside updates (mirror logic).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4) Swap simulation loop (contract-faithful)\n",
        "For each swap event (final `sqrtPriceX96_f`, `tick_f`, and signed `amount0/1`):\n",
        "1. Starting state: previous event's final state (or `slot0` at `t0`).\n",
        "2. Determine direction and input token from sign of `amount{0,1}` (positive indicates input for that token in Uniswap v3 logs).\n",
        "3. While current `sqrtPriceX96` != `sqrtPriceX96_f`:\n",
        "   - Compute next tick boundary `sqrtPriceNext = sqrtPriceAtTick(nextTick)` based on direction.\n",
        "   - Run `swapStep`:\n",
        "     - Compute amount to move to `sqrtPriceNext` or to final, considering fee-on-input and rounding rules.\n",
        "     - Compute `feeAmount` for input token, split protocol vs LPs.\n",
        "     - Update `feeGrowthGlobal{input}` by `(feeAmount_LP << 128) / L_active`.\n",
        "     - Update `sqrtPriceX96`, `tick`, and if boundary reached, apply `feeGrowthOutside` updates and `L_active += liquidityNet`.\n",
        "4. Validate that end state matches event (`sqrtPriceX96_f`, `tick_f`, `liquidity` if provided). Log any deltas for diagnostics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5) Position fee queries (any range, any time window)\n",
        "- For window `[t0, t1]`, capture snapshots of:\n",
        "  - `feeGrowthGlobal{0,1}X128(t0)`, `(t1)` and all `feeGrowthOutside{0,1}X128` at both times.\n",
        "- For a position `(tickLower, tickUpper)`:\n",
        "  - `feeGrowthInside = feeGrowthGlobal - feeGrowthBelow - feeGrowthAbove` per v3:\n",
        "    - Below/Above computed from `feeGrowthOutside` using current tick at each snapshot.\n",
        "  - `fees_token0 = L_pos * (feeGrowthInside0X128(t1) - feeGrowthInside0X128(t0)) >> 128` (likewise token1).\n",
        "- This enables fast evaluation for many candidate ranges (ideal for RL).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6) Protocol fee handling\n",
        "- Decode `slot0.feeProtocol` per token at each time (two 4-bit values packed):\n",
        "  - Implement exact core semantics: LP share = `feeAmount * (256 - protocolFee) / 256` (or per-core rule).\n",
        "  - If the dataset lacks precise protocol fee changes, default to 0 and allow override.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7) Robustness, ordering, and edge cases\n",
        "- Event ordering: strictly sort by `(block_number, log_index)` if available; otherwise timestamp, then tx hash.\n",
        "- Zero or tiny liquidity: skip steps if `L_active == 0` (no fee growth possible); warn.\n",
        "- Tick extremes: guard against min/max tick; clamp as in core.\n",
        "- Duplicate timestamps: process sequentially; state continuity is defined by prior event.\n",
        "- Gaps: price changes only via swaps; `slot0` is used only for initial state validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8) Performance plan (for RL workloads)\n",
        "- Precompute growth timelines:\n",
        "  - Maintain cumulative `feeGrowthGlobal{0,1}X128` and `feeGrowthOutside{0,1}X128` over the window.\n",
        "  - Optional: persist per-tick cumulative arrays to disk for fast random access.\n",
        "- Query engine:\n",
        "  - Given many `(tickLower, tickUpper)` and `(t0, t1)`, compute fees with O(1)/O(log N) using growth snapshots.\n",
        "- Parallelization: shard by time or by candidate ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9) Validation\n",
        "- Fee mass balance: sum of LP fees equals total fee paid minus protocol fees.\n",
        "- End-state consistency: simulated `sqrtPriceX96`, `tick`, `L_active` equal event finals.\n",
        "- Cross-check with spot The Graph pools or known backtests for sample windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10) Implementation checklist\n",
        "- Parsers: swaps, mints, burns, slot0, pool config, tokens.\n",
        "- Tick map builder: from snapshot or full event replay to `t0`.\n",
        "- Core math primitives: `sqrtPriceAtTick`, `tickAtSqrtPrice`, `getAmount{0,1}Delta` with rounding.\n",
        "- Swap engine with `swapStep` loop and tick crossing.\n",
        "- Growth stores: globals and per-tick outside.\n",
        "- Position fee query: `feeGrowthInside` delta → token0/1 fees.\n",
        "- Test suite: unit tests on math, step transitions, and an end-to-end small window.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you approve this plan, I’ll implement the stateful engine and growth accounting first, then add the position query and validation utilities.\n"
